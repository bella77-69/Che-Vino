            Buying wine can be overwhelming, due to the variety of wines on the
            shelves. The Che Vino helps take the guess work out of making that
            decision. Che Vino determines a bottle of wine at random. You have
            the choice of the different types of wine avaiable, such as Red,
            White, Dessert, Port, Rose, or Sparkling Wine. Checkout the seach
            page that shows the top 20 wines. There you can read comments about
            the wine, see the wine score, and the average price. Enjoy, and
            remember to drink responsible!
